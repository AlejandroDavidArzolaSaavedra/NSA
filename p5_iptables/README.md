This practice aims to familiarize you with the use of IPTables, a firewall used in Linux systems. The goal is to configure filtering rules on the gateway to ensure network security and allow access only to specific services.

## Objectives ðŸŽ¯
- Configure the IPTables filter table on the gateway.
- Establish deny policies in the INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD chains.
- Maintain the OpenVPN connection.
- Restrict DNS resolutions and web traffic through specific rules.
- Secure traffic with the gateway.
